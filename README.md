## About the Design and Simulations

This repository contains the simulations done using NI Multisim 14.1+. The files are ready to be opened from the said version of the software. Download NI Multisim Education Edition 14.0 using the below-mentioned instructions. It is a full featured software for learning circuit design.

## Step-1: Clone the git repository
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Installation

Click here to download the [NI Multisim](http://sno.filex.no-ip.org/download?file=multisim+program) into your system.

## Usage

The oscillator is an
important block in electronic devices which work on the principle of oscillation. The oscillators can be
designed from a wide range of well-known topologies. However, not all types of the oscillators can be
integrated. The crystal oscillator is one of the oscillators which is impossible to integrate into CMOS
technology.
